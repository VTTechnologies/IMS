                                A valid credit card is required for paying accounts. Trial accounts are not required to provide a credit card number. If you initially sign up for a paid account, and you don't cancel that account within the trial number of days. If you cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice, you will not be charged. If you subscribe to paid plan during your free trial you will be charged at the end of the trial period to ensure that you have the first 90 days i.e. the duration of the trial period, free of cost. You will be billed for your first month or year upon completion of the trial period. The Service is billed in advance, per your choosing, on a monthly or yearly basis and is non-refundable under any circumstances. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only (state) taxes. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. IMS BIZZ does not accept any liability for such loss.

This information cannot be recovered once deleted.
